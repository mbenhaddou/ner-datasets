Datasets for Entity Recognition
===============================

This repository contains datasets from several domains and languages
annotated with a variety of entity types, useful for entity recognition and
named entity recognition (NER) tasks.


**NOTE: I am actively adding datasets to this list

Datasets for NER in English
===========================

.. |check| unicode:: 0x2714

The following table shows the list of datasets for English-language entity recognition (for a list of NER datasets in other languages, see below). The `data` directory
contains information on where to obtain those datasets which could not be shared
due to licensing restrictions, as well as code to convert them (if necessary)
to the CoNLL 2003 format. Links to NER corpora in other languages
are also listed below.

Notes on licenses:


The data set are under various type of licences.
I do not have the time to worry about the licences now
